Presentation for FIAF CDC Preservation/Restoration Documentation Task Force about current and future(?) practices of documenting preservation processes at the moving image archive of the National Library of Norway.
Examples based on film scanner/post-processing processes, but future aims are general and can be applied to other processes as well.
