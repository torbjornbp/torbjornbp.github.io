Ten years ago I did not drink tea. It's not that I wasn't exposed to it, the bitter drink just never really caught my attention. 

Around 2013 something clicked though, and I became utterly fascinated by Chinese tea and tea culture. I can't remember exactly what triggered the interest, but it was something I read about puerh LEGG TIL LENKE tea. I think it might have been some texts about or from the artist Lars Holdhus/TCF.

I have a tendency to go into these monomanic phases of complete and intense submersion in some field or topic. This was the point where I fell down the rabbit hole and read everything I could find about tea. Tea types, tea production, history, brewing methods, utensils, ceramics, porcelain, ceremonies, economy, philosophy etc. Mind you for the first few years, this was limited to *reading* about tea.
