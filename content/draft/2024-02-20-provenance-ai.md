BRUK HISTORICAL RECORDS SOM BEGREP

## Alternative versions of content
A worry about whether you can trust archives has been gnawing at me lately. In part due to the strides generative AI has made over the past year, and in part due to Henrik G. Bastiansen's book[^1] about mass digitization at the National Library of Norway (and the subsequent panel discussion about the book held here at the National Library a few weeks back[^2]). I'm worried about a crisis of confidence in previously trusted institutions.

The appearance of alternate versions texts poses questions about the authenticity of *all* versions of that text. An object without context, is not only questionable in itself, it puts into question the authenticity of its well-documented peers and their documentation. If you lack the proper provenance information for the files in your digital collection, you will struggle to maintain their claim of authenticity when alternate versions of their content appears. 

This is an old problem. The core issue is raised by the appearance of alternate versions, regardless of whether they are created by AI generated or not. However, the issue is exacerbated by AI, as the bar for creating alternate versions is lowered. 

How do you know that the version in the archive is the authentic version? Is it even possible for the archive to prove something's authenticiy? If we are talking about digitized materials, you can use the analog original to validate your claim - as long as you still have the analog copy... For digitally born material, however, you stand on shakier grounds. Files with little provenance or context are hard to authenticate.

Archives are traditionally institutions of authority, their collections are usually assumed to be trustworthy a priori. However, why should you trust the archive? Just because they have been trustworthy in the past?

## Substantiation of authenticity
Checksumming and extensive provenance metadata helps *substantiate* a claim of authenticity, but it is still just substantiation. If the archive controls the entire chain of systems managing the digital collection, what is stopping anyone in the archive from tampering with the checksums and provenance metadata? Perhaps it's a good idea to publish your checksums somewhere out of your control, to further strengthen your substantiation claim?

Again, this is not an AI problem. Why should you trust the archives of today or of the past? Why should you trust their analog collections? If we are talking about film archives for example: How do you know the colors of a preservation copy are representative of the "original" colors? Most likely they are not... Can you even trust a film archive's analog originals? If you ask enough difficult questions, you quickly end up with a crisis of trust.

## Digitization and mediation
These are old challenges of provenance, that I feel many have been completely blind to in the analog context. The moment a process or medium is digital, people assume it behaves in entirely new ways. I completely disagree with this. In my view, the digital domain behaves surprisingly similar to its analog counterpart. 

Bastiansen's book that I mentioned earlier raises questions about how a cultural object changes the moment it is digitized. A TIFF resulting from scanning a paper newspaper is not "the newspaper". "Reading" the TIFF and reading the newspaper are different ways of consuming media. 

<!-- Bastiansen spends some time in the book quoting Lev Manovich talking about databases and their metadata is something new. DET ER DE IKKE. NOE OM AT DE ER DET SAMME; MEN KAN BRUKES PÅ MER EFFEKTIVE MÅTER


hey have existed in analog forms before, card file indexes for example are similar to 

EKSEMPEL OM TRANSCODING. ANALOGT MATERIALE "TRANSCODES" OGSÅ = MEDIATION -->

However, both Bastiansen and his critics seem to have a blindspot when it comes to the *analog* mediums. The analog technological mediation tends to be taken completely for granted in their analyses. The printed word is presented in such a "self-mediating" way, that you easily become blind to how its mediating technology actually works. There is paper, pages, ink, lettering, etc. 

It is something new. I agree with this notion in part: the intellectual content or message in the newspaper is mediated in two different ways. However, both the TIFF and the newspaper are mediums.

<!-- LEGG TIL DEFINISJON FRA FILM CURATION - FILM AS SYSTEM. -->
## Analog mediation
Similarly to printed text, film is by design not drawing any attention to its mediating technology, but there is a lot going on to produce a moving image. Let's agree that the colors in a color film are an important aspect of its intellectual content. 

If blue is exchanged for green, that is a significant change in the film's content and message. When you see a film, you see projected light. How that projected light appears is dependent on the mediating technology: the viewing environment, the type of screen, the type of projector light, the type of projector speed, the condition of the print, the type of print, how the print was color graded and printed and so on and so on...

For digitized materials you still have to account for the entirety of this analog technological framework, but you also have to account for the digitization framework (the type of digitization equipment and parameters, post-processing, format, etc.), *and* the technological viewing platform (the type of playback equipment and environment). This mediation is both complex and completely opaque to the general viewer.

<!-- ## conclusion working title

- Tie analog mediation and back to crisis of confidence in some way


Review of markdown text:

 Fallacies or illogical conclusions:

The text suggests that the appearance of alternate versions automatically casts doubt on the authenticity of all versions, which is not necessarily true.
It raises the question of "authenticity" without clearly defining what that means in this context.
 Points needing clarification:

The text mentions "extensive provenance metadata" but doesn't elaborate on what it entails.
The discussion about film color fidelity needs further explanation on how color changes can affect meaning.
The concept of "mediation" in analog and digital contexts requires clearer definition and examples.
 Suggested conclusion:

 The text effectively highlights the ongoing challenge of establishing and maintaining trust in historical records, both analog and digital. It emphasizes the importance of robust provenance information and critical awareness of the mediation processes involved in all forms of content creation and preservation.

 Further suggestions:

The conclusion could connect the discussions on analog and digital mediation to address the initial concern about trust in archives.
Consider exploring potential solutions or strategies for mitigating the challenges of trust and authenticity in the digital age.
 Overall, the text raises valuable points about the complexities of trust and authenticity in the context of archives and digital information. With some clarification and a stronger conclusion, it can offer a more nuanced and insightful perspective on this critical issue.

In the context of historical records in archives, authenticity refers to the trustworthiness and reliability of a record as a genuine representation of what it purports to be. This encompasses several key aspects:

1. Origin: The record must be demonstrably created by the claimed author or source at the claimed time.
2. Content: The content of the record should be accurate and unaltered from its original state.
3. Context: The record should be accompanied by sufficient information about its creation, transmission, and custody to understand its meaning and significance.

 Therefore, an authentic historical record is not just a copy of something, but rather a reliable piece of evidence that can be used to understand the past.

 Here's how the points mentioned above relate to the challenges discussed in the text:

Alternate versions: While the existence of alternate versions can raise questions about the specific content of a record, it doesn't necessarily negate its authenticity altogether. Examining the provenance and context of each version is crucial for determining their individual trustworthiness.
Provenance information: Extensive provenance metadata, including details about the record's creation, ownership, and any changes it underwent, plays a crucial role in establishing its authenticity.
Digital vs. analog: Both analog and digital records face challenges related to authenticity. While digital manipulation might seem easier, analog records are also susceptible to alterations or degradation over time. Understanding the specific mediation processes involved in each case is vital for assessing their reliability.
 By considering these elements, archivists and researchers can work towards ensuring the authenticity and trustworthiness of historical records, both in their original forms and in various digital representations. -->
