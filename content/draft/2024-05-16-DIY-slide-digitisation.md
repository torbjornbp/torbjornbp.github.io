title: DIY dia slide digitisation

In 2022 I set out to digitize a portion of my grandfather's diapositives/slides. They're pretty great and go back to the early 50s. There's also lot of them (many more than I initially thought), and some of them are quite badly color faded.

My parents had bought a slide digitizer (OpticFilm) a few year prior, to digitize all of them, but it proved to be a time consuming ordeal, with middling results. The machine uses silverfast and is capable of outputting quite good results, however, it is pretty slow. What was worse though, was that my parents had saved lossy jpegs instead of tiffs, which made a lot of files of the more darker and colour faded slides almost useless...
