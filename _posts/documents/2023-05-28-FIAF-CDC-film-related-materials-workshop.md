Presentation held at the FIAF CDC Workshop ["So Much More Than Non-Film: Cataloguing Film-Related Materials"](https://www.fiafnet.org/pages/Training/CDC-Workshop-2023-Film-related-Materials.html) in Stockholm 25.05.2023. Presentation focused on the ongoing migration work from the Mavis system to Axiell Collections at the National Library of Norway. Emphasis on how the LRM/EN15907 models can be applied in a generic manner for different types of materials. Some thoughts on "marrying" catalog models with traditional archiving models.
