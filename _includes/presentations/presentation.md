## Cataloging

- Multitude of cataloging systems in use
	- Various sizes, ages and complexity

    

- AV materials -> Mavis (1996-2024)
	- Central system for all* AV-materials (images, sound recordings and moving images)

---

## Mavis

- Not just a catalog: names, acquisitions, conditions, treatments, loans, locations, etc.
- Common cataloguing practices for all AV-materials
- Non-standard, but relatively **generic data model**
	- Non-generic items
