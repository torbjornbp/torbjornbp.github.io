This is my personal web page, where I have tried to gather texts I have written, presentations I have held and other things I have done.

I'm a moving image archivist and P&P alumni. I have ten years of experience as a moving image archivist and have worked extensively with film collections, cataloging, identification, selection, photochemical and digital preservation, etc. Starting from 2024 I'm working as product lead for digital preservation.
