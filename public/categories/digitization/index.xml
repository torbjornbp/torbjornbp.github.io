They&amp;rsquo;re pretty great and go back to the early 50s. There&amp;rsquo;s also lot of them (many more than I initially thought), and some of them are quite badly color faded.
My parents had bought a slide digitizer (OpticFilm) a few year prior, to digitize all of them, but it proved to be a time consuming ordeal, with middling results.</description></item></channel></rss>
