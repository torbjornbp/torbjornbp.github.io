It was a challenging undertaking that kept me busy for a few years. Due to the complexity of the project and research, I&rsquo;ve never been happy with how I managed to document all the work I put into it. My sources were a sprawling mess, and the comparison and identification of film elements quite exhausting. In essence I lacked the framework and tools for systematizing all of it in a structured way.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to revisit the project and write something more extensive about it for a long time, but have never found the time. There has seldom been any breathing room for reflection or rest in the moving images department&mldr; I recently took on new role as product lead for digital preservation at the National Library, and this has finally given me some time to clear my thoughts.</p><p>I had initially intended to write a single text or article about the restoration project in question. As I began working on the outline of topics I would have liked to cover, I quickly realized that such a text would be very long. Instead, I will split it into a small series of texts, using the project to explore various topics and challenges related to preservation and methodology in general.</p><blockquote><p>noe om at teksten går en omvei til Selvig, legger opp fundament for å snakke om kompleksitet i sekundære kilder.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=a-stemmatology-of-film>A stemmatology of film?</h2><p>I recently caught a presentation by Serena Belotti of the work done on a digital critical edition of <strong>La battaglia dall’Astico al Piave</strong> (1918). There is also a fascinating <a href=https://doi.org/10.6092/ISSN.2280-9481/13539>paper</a> by Simone Venturini about the project<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. The critical edition demonstrates an elaborate and detailed framework for documenting restoration and reconstruction work and was the initiator of me writing this.</p><p>One of the things that fascinated me the most in the paper was it&rsquo;s use of <em>stemmatology</em> for ordering film versions and surviving elements. Stemmatology was a new concept for me, but I was immediately smitten by it, and I’ve been reading up on it since. In very basic terms it is a methodology in the field of textual criticism used to analyze and compare surviving texts and versions of texts. The core idea is to trace the history and relationships between these texts to identify common errors or variations, allowing scholars to infer a text&rsquo;s original form.</p><p>This is can be rendered visually as a &ldquo;stemma&rdquo; - or &ldquo;family tree&rdquo; - showing how different copies stem from common ancestors. By mapping these relationships, stemmatology helps scholars understand the evolution and transmission of texts over time, aiming to get as close as possible to the author&rsquo;s original work. The end result is a genealogy of text (or perhaps textual content?).</p><p>What I particularly like, is that the stemma are quite intuitive and beautiful ways of visualizing data!

What is its known versions? What are the surviving elements. It could also help you define the aims of your project more clearly. Which text are you trying to reconstruct? Which text are you actually able to reconstruct?</p><p>Below is the stemma from Simone Venturini&rsquo;s paper on <strong>La battaglia dall’Astico al Piave</strong> (1918).</p><hr><p><img src=/assets/img/nvn/stemma-bataglia.webp alt></p><hr><h2 id=film-ontology>Film ontology</h2><p>I began reading up on stemmatology and quickly realized it is not completely straight forward to apply to film. Furthermore, it touches on core ontological questions related to film: What is a film? In film archives this is a challenge of <em>cataloging</em>.</p><p>The concept of original texts and versioning is an important aspect of film cataloging. In the EN15907 standard we can describe such differences in content by using the concepts of &ldquo;works,&rdquo; &ldquo;variants,&rdquo; and &ldquo;manifestations&rdquo;. In the new FIAFcore ontology, we operate with &ldquo;work/variants&rdquo; and &ldquo;manifestations&rdquo;. In the IFLA LRM model we similarly can describe materials as &ldquo;works,&rdquo; &ldquo;expresions,&rdquo; or manifestations. Here the variants and expressions do the heavy lifting, but I believe the manifestations is essential here. These content description models build branching trees of their own!</p><blockquote><p>film text = film content</p></blockquote><p>To me it seems like the intellectual hierarchies found in bibliographic reference models is the librarian solution to the same problems stemmatology tries to solve.</p><p>As I discussed in a previous text ==SETT INN LINK==, these bibliographic models are geared towards describing content. This is also one of their weaknesses in my view</p><p>A weakness of these bibliographic models is their gearing towards describing and finding published materials. There are good reasons for this, as the end users tend to be interested in the published materials. However, it is a constant challenge when you are dealing with unpublished archival materials (which there are plenty of in film archives). As archivists and researchers, we also need to organize all these other elements. The work/expression/manifestation defintions do not really function as well, when we attempt to fit in the myriad production elements and preservation elements in our collections.</p><blockquote><p>noen eksempler fra definisjoner + elementtyper. verk/variant-skiller definert ut fra innhold/klipp, men negativene er uklipte.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>fjerning av rene avskrifter, kanskje ikke så relevant?

For dokumentarfilm noe som gjerne kommer før verket (ala samples i musikk).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Contamination gir lite mening, når man tar det uredigerte negativet og klipping med i betraktninga. contaminations skjer før materiale kommer inn i arkiver+etter materialet kommer inn i arkiver. Udokumenterte endringer/utilsiktede endringer. Sammenhengende trær helt normalt</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=suggestions-for-improvement-about-stemma>Suggestions for Improvement about stemma:</h2><ol><li>Expand on Practical Applications: While you&rsquo;ve made a clear case for the potential relevance of stemmatology in film studies, expanding on specific examples or scenarios where this methodology could be applied in film history and preservation would further strengthen your argument. For instance, how could stemmatology aid in the restoration of a particular film, or in understanding the evolution of a film&rsquo;s different versions?</li><li>Discuss Challenges and Limitations: Addressing potential challenges or limitations in applying a textual criticism methodology to film could provide a more balanced view. For example, the physical nature of film and the impact of technological changes on film formats could be unique challenges not faced in textual criticism.</li></ol><p>A &ldquo;stemma codicum&rdquo; is a term used primarily in the field of textual criticism and philology. It refers to a diagram that resembles a family tree and is used to show the relationships between various manuscripts of a text. This tool helps scholars understand how different versions of a text have evolved and diverged over time, often due to copying errors, revisions, or additions made by scribes.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a basic breakdown of how a stemma codicum works:</p><ul><li>Root: The root represents the original text (often hypothetical, as the original is rarely extant) from which all the manuscripts derive.</li><li>Branches: Each branch stemming from the root represents a manuscript or a group of manuscripts. The branching shows how these manuscripts are related to each other, indicating which ones are derived from common ancestors.</li><li>Nodes: The points where branches divide represent the instances where a new copy (or copies) of a manuscript was made. Each node can represent a point in time where copying errors, insertions, or deletions occurred, leading to variations in the text.</li><li>Leaves: The ends of the branches represent the existing manuscripts that have been preserved and are available to scholars.</li></ul><p>The stemma codicum is crucial in establishing a &ldquo;critical edition&rdquo; of a text. By analyzing the relationships between manuscripts, scholars can make informed decisions about which readings are likely to be closest to the original text. This process is fundamental in the study of ancient and medieval texts, where multiple manuscript traditions often exist.</p><p>si noe om hva det munnet ut og artikler perhaps? <a href=https://rushprint.no/2023/08/filmen-og-nasjonen/>https://rushprint.no/2023/08/filmen-og-nasjonen/</a></p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Venturini, Simone. “From Edge to Edge: The Restoration of La Battaglia Dall’Astico al Piave (1918) and the Search for a Digital Historical-Critical Infrastructure.” <em>Cinergie – Il Cinema e Le Altre Arti</em>, December 20, 2021, 45-68. <a href=https://doi.org/10.6092/ISSN.2280-9481/13539>https://doi.org/10.6092/ISSN.2280-9481/13539</a>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Haugen, Odd Einar, ed. <em>Handbok i norrøn filologi</em>.
