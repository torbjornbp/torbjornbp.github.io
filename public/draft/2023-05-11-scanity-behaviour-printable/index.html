This text is a condensation of information found in the Scanity manual and the &ldquo;Scanity white paper&rdquo;, in addition to information discovered through testing performed on Scanity #201 at the National Library of Norway.</p><blockquote><p>Due to the Scanity manual being copyrighted and confidential, the information in this document should not be shared with anyone not owning a Scanity.</p></blockquote><h2 id=rgb-light-path>RGB light path</h2><p>The Scanity uses spectrally-separate red, green and blue LED light sources. The Scanity has two sets of red LEDs with slightly different center wavelengths: <strong>Red 0</strong> for materials with an orange mask (negatives/intermediates) and <strong>Red 1</strong> that should be used for print film. The <strong>red LED type</strong> to be used is selected using the <strong><a href=#filmstock-presets>Filmstock presets</a></strong>.</p><p>In this document the light sources are referred to as &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo; (rather than &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo;), as this corresponds with how the configuration of the <strong>Filmstock</strong> presets selects <strong>red LED type</strong> (see <a href=#selecting-red-led-type-to-be-used-isprint>IsPrint setting</a>).</p><p>The &ldquo;Investigation of Film Material–Scanner Interaction&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> states that the exact spectral characteristics of the LEDs are:</p><ul><li>Red 0: 660nm (colour negative/intermediate)</li><li>Red 1: 690nm (positive print)</li><li>Green: 530nm</li><li>Blue : 446nm</li></ul><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113333557/225334504-823bf215-234e-4b7f-b141-a4745b0e15d8.png alt="Scanity RGB light path"></p><p>The light from the LEDs passes through an integration sphere, which assures uniform and diffuse<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> lighting, before it passes through the film, into a colour beam splitter, before hitting the red, green and blue TDI sensors<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. More information about the light path is found in the <a href=https://www.dft-film.com/downloads/datasheets/Scanity-Whitepaper.pdf>Scanity whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Preliminary test-scans of Kodak 2242 intermediate material using the two different <strong>red LED types</strong> indicate subtle differences in captured data. The most obvious difference seem to be information being &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; near <strong>maximum density</strong> (D-max) in the red channel (resulting in redder shadows), when using the <strong>Red 1</strong> light source intended for print film.</p><p>Further testing should be performed to determine the impact the choice of <strong>red LED type</strong> has on captured data.</p><p>A basic intro to sensitometry concepts mentioned in this document like <strong>Density</strong> and <strong>Printer lights</strong>, are found at the end of this document (see <a href=#appendix-sensitometry-basics>Appendix: Sensitometry basics</a>).</p><h3 id=settings-influencing-captured-data>Settings influencing captured data</h3><p>Apart from the choice of <strong>red LED type</strong>, the only other setting that influence the amount of information captured by the sensor is the <strong>Light</strong> setting (&ldquo;Light (Minimum density)&rdquo; in the Scanity interface). The <strong>Light</strong> setting can be adjusted individually for red, green and blue, and controls the light intensity of the scanner LED light sources. The unit for this setting is printer light points, with a neutral setting of 25 for each colour channel (see <a href=#filmstock-configuration-formatting>light setting offsets</a>).</p><blockquote><p>Scanning in <strong>monochrome HDR</strong> is also an option that influence captured data, but at the moment this document is primarily concerned with colour materials. When using the monochrome HDR option, the <strong>Red 0</strong> light source is used<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=rgb-data-path>RGB data path</h2><p>The 16bit RGB data coming from the <strong>sensor</strong> goes through several processing steps in the shape of LUTs<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> and Matrixes<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> before a file is rendered:</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113333557/225334788-9701f9aa-e47e-47d6-b4b0-f8c887aa17f1.png alt="Scanity RGB data path"></p><p>→ <strong>L1 LUT</strong> (&ldquo;LUT Color space Log&rdquo;). The <strong>L1 LUT</strong> should in theory turn the linear data into logarithmic data.

The data is now 16bit log. →</p><p>→ <strong>3x3 matrix</strong> (&ldquo;Color space Matrix&rdquo;). The default option is a &ldquo;1:1&rdquo; matrix (bypass).

The final processing stage before a file is output. The <strong>Main LUT</strong> can process the data in several possible ways.</p><h3 id=lut-matrix-lut>LUT-Matrix-LUT</h3><p>The default &ldquo;1:1&rdquo; settings in the LUT-Matrix-LUT pipeline does not do anything to the data. The manual states that the &ldquo;1:1 LUT and 1:1 matrix selection [&mldr;] will set the stages into a bypass mode&rdquo;. Steps 2 to 4 can thus be ignored, as long as the default 1:1 settings are used.</p><p>You can define custom <strong>L1</strong>/<strong>L2 LUTs</strong> and <strong>Matrixes</strong>. It is assumed such data processing could be applied as easily in a later stage of post-processing. The possible benefits of setting up a custom LUT-Matrix-LUT path, should be explored.</p><p>Unless custom settings are used, the data is formatted as 16bit linear when the <strong>Main LUT</strong> is applied.</p><h3 id=main-lut>Main LUT</h3><p>The <strong>Main LUT</strong> is more complicated, as it is created on a per scan-basis based on the configuration of three settings found in the software:</p><ul><li><strong>Characteristic</strong><ul><li>This is the core part of the <strong>Main LUT</strong>. It consists of three default LUTs/gamma curves + user defined custom LUTs:<ul><li>LIN (linear)</li><li>CRT (&ldquo;TV Gamma 2.2&rdquo;, logarithmic)</li><li>CPD (&ldquo;Cineon Print Density&rdquo;, logarithmic)</li><li>CUSTOM (special conditions apply, see <a href=#custom-main-lut>below</a>)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Postive/negative</strong><ul><li>This setting is used to invert the image.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Density range</strong> (&ldquo;Density range (transition)&rdquo;)<ul><li>This setting applies gamma/gain adjustments to the selected <strong>Characteristic</strong> LUT/curve, according to the manual. (This seems to apply <strong>Lift</strong>, rather than <strong>Gain</strong>)</li><li>As indicated by the naming in the <a href=#filmstock-configuration-formatting>formatting</a> of the <strong>Filmstock</strong> setting, it is likely that the intended way to use this setting is to define maximum density (Dmax) of each colour channel for a particular film stock (as per film stock specifications).</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=custom-main-lut>Custom Main LUT</h4><p>In addition to the three predefined characteristics, you can define a <strong>custom Main LUT</strong>. This is done by selecting a custom LUT using the <strong>Characteristic</strong> setting. When a custom <strong>Main LUT</strong> is used, the <strong>Positive/negative</strong> and <strong>Density range</strong> settings are deactivated.</p><h3 id=filmstock-presets>Filmstock presets</h3><p>To complicate matters there are also film stock presets that influences your result.</p><p>The selected <strong>Filmstock</strong> will apply preset values to several other settings on the Scanity. They are made for optimal(?) capture of various different analog film stocks. There are several predefined <strong>Filmstock</strong> presets (eg. a preset for Kodak 2242). The default preset is called &ldquo;<strong>Print</strong>&rdquo;.</p><p>Selecting a <strong>Filmstock</strong> preset sets these core settings to predefined values in the Scanity software:</p><ul><li><strong>Red LED type</strong> (no visual indication of toggle in software)</li><li><strong>Light</strong> (no visual indication of changes in software)</li><li><strong>Positive/negative</strong></li><li><strong>Density range</strong></li><li><strong>L1/L2 LUTs + colour space matrix</strong> (all predefined film stocks use the default 1:1 settings)</li></ul><h4 id=filmstock-configuration-formatting>Filmstock configuration formatting</h4><p>The <strong>Filmstock</strong> configuration file is formatted like this (space delimited):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>&#34;name&#34; WhiteDensity(r g b) BlackDensity(r g b) IsNegative IsPrint IsFactoryMem ColorSpaceLog ColorSpaceMatrix ColorSpaceDelog

The operator needs to be aware of the offsets in the presets used, as these offsets are hard to detect within the Scanity software. When selecting and loading a <strong>Filmstock</strong> preset with modified <strong>Light</strong> settings (values of anything other than 25), the <strong>Light</strong> values will still appear as red=25 green=25 blue=25 in the Scanity interface. These settings represent different <strong>Light</strong> settings than red=25 green=25 blue=25 using the default <strong>Print</strong> preset.</p><p>The default <strong>Print</strong> preset is defined with 0 offsets to the <strong>Light</strong> settings and <strong>Density range</strong> settings of exact 3.5.</p><h4 id=density-range-offsets>Density range offsets?</h4><p>An unexpected behaviour discovered while looking at the <strong>Filmstock</strong> settings, is that changing <strong>Light</strong> settings create offsets to the <strong>Density range</strong> settings. This can be confirmed by checking the <strong>Filmstock</strong> settings/config file.</p><p>Increasing <strong>Lights</strong> by 1 printer light point, yields an increase in <strong>Density range</strong> of 0.02509. This is not visible in the software, where the <strong>Density range</strong> will appear untouched. In the <strong>Filmstock</strong> config file however, settings with <strong>Lights</strong> of 26 and an untouched <strong>Density range</strong> of 3.5, will be stored as <strong>Light</strong> offsets of 0.0250858 and a <strong>Density range</strong> of 3.52509.</p><p>Considering the offsets&rsquo; relationship to printer light steps (changes of 0.025 $\log E$), it is assumed that the <strong>Density range</strong> offsets are applied to somehow better emulate the behaviour of printer lights in photochemical printing or the cineon workflow. Another possibility is that it is there to camouflage the sensor noise floor. The reasoning behind this behaviour needs to be explained by DFT.</p><p>Initial tests indicate that increased <strong>Light</strong> settings behave similarly to increased printer lights, <em>up until</em> a density of 1.8-2 (if using the LIN characteristic). If you are using a custom linear <strong>Main LUT</strong> the lights behave linearly up to a density of 2.2-2.5. Information in higher densities than this, behave non-linearly, and will form a &ldquo;toe&rdquo; in the gamma curve.</p><p>Further tests should be carried out to explore this behaviour.</p><h2 id=alpha-component-lightdata-path>Alpha component light/data path</h2><p>In addition to the RGB components of the data, the Scanity produces an <strong>Alpha component</strong> based on information in the IR spectrum. This data is used to create a &ldquo;dirt/scratch matte&rdquo;, that can be used to identify (and post-process) dirt and scratches on the film. The description of the IR light and data path is less detailed than for the RGB light/data, but the &ldquo;Dirt&rdquo; page in the Scanity settings controls the <em>processing</em> of the data.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113333557/225338455-2616282c-8d4c-417f-84c4-2ccbe09eb000.png alt="Alpha component light/data path?"></p><p>It seems the IR data goes through it&rsquo;s own data path. The data processing can be set in a bypass mode that should produce an output that &ldquo;reflects the IR signal of the camera&rdquo;. It appears the IR sensor is of the same TDI design as the RGB sensors.</p><blockquote><p>As the aim of this document (for now) is to determine how &ldquo;visible&rdquo; colour information is captured by the Scanity, the <strong>Alpha component</strong> can be ignored.</p></blockquote><h2 id=producing-a-linear-scan>Producing a linear scan</h2><p>If you want to keep the processing of the sensor data to a minimum, and keep it as &ldquo;raw&rdquo; as possible, you need to keep the data linear. However, it is not enough to use the LIN <strong>Characteristic</strong>, as we have shown that other settings influence the <strong>Main LUT</strong>. For strictly linear results the Scanity manual states that you need to use these settings:</p><ul><li><strong>Characteristic</strong>: LIN</li><li><strong>Positive/Negative</strong>: Positive</li><li><strong>Density Range</strong>: 3.5</li></ul><p>You can also produce a linear scan by applying a linear <strong>custom Main LUT</strong> (1=1, 2=2, etc). It does <em>not</em> produce the same results as the settings <strong>Positive/LIN/3.5 Density range</strong>. The results using a Custom linear LUT, is linear data over a longer density range than using the LIN characteristic.</p><p>The LIN characteristic seems to apply a toe at the darkest densities of the curve. The reason for the addition of this toe, might be to camouflage the noise-floor, which is easily visible in these density ranges using a Custom Linear LUT. A custom linear Main LUT thus seem to produce a scan closer to raw sensor data, but might be impractical in use.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RujIZdL.png alt="Characterstic comparison (red channel)"></p><p>===</p><h2 id=appendix-sensitometry-basics>Appendix: Sensitometry basics</h2><p>Several concepts and numbers that appear in this document makes more sense with a sensitometry context.

It works by changing brightness values (of a pixel), by mapping each input value to a new output value based on a table (the LUT). LUTs come in two flavours: 1D LUTs and 3D LUTs. 1D LUTs modify data on a single axis (gamma/contrast for all channels), while a 3D LUT modifies data around on three axes separately (R, G and B). 1D LUTs can modify gamma/white balance, but not modify colour <em>gamut</em>. 3D LUTs can do both. The Scanity operates with 1D LUTs, or rather 3x1D LUTs (a 1D LUT for each colour channel R, G and B, packed in a single file).
