In part due to the strides generative AI has made over the past year, and in part due to Henrik G. Bastiansen&rsquo;s book<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> about mass digitization at the National Library of Norway (and the subsequent panel discussion about the book held here at the National Library a few weeks back<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>). I&rsquo;m worried about a crisis of confidence in previously trusted institutions.</p><ul><li>SI NOE OM AT ARKIVER SOM INSTITUSJONER SOM HOLDER HISTORICAL RECORDS (I BRED BETYDNING).</li><li>FOR OSS ER EN AVLEVERT AI_GENERERT TING LIKESTILT MED EN ANNEN AVLEVERT TING.</li><li>historical records står ikke på egne bein uansett, de må fortolkes</li><li>bekymret for kopier avledet av originale historical records</li></ul><p>The appearance of alternate versions texts poses questions about the authenticity of <em>all</em> versions of that text. An object without context, is not only questionable in itself, it puts into question the authenticity of its well-documented peers and their documentation. If you lack the proper provenance information for the files in your digital collection, you will struggle to maintain their claim of authenticity when alternate versions of their content appears.</p><p>This is an old problem. The core issue is raised by the appearance of alternate versions, regardless of whether they are created by AI generated or not. However, the issue is exacerbated by AI, as the bar for creating alternate versions is lowered.</p><p>How do you know that the version in the archive is the authentic version? Is it even possible for the archive to prove something&rsquo;s authenticiy? If we are talking about digitized materials, you can use the analog original to validate your claim - as long as you still have the analog copy&mldr; For digitally born material, however, you stand on shakier grounds. Files with little provenance or context are hard to authenticate.</p><p>Archives are traditionally institutions of authority, their collections are usually assumed to be trustworthy a priori. However, why should you trust the archive? Just because they have been trustworthy in the past?</p><h2 id=substantiation-of-authenticity>Substantiation of authenticity</h2><p>Checksumming and extensive provenance metadata helps <em>substantiate</em> a claim of authenticity, but it is still just substantiation. If the archive controls the entire chain of systems managing the digital collection, what is stopping anyone in the archive from tampering with the checksums and provenance metadata? Perhaps it&rsquo;s a good idea to publish your checksums somewhere out of your control, to further strengthen your substantiation claim?</p><p>Again, this is not an AI problem. Why should you trust the archives of today or of the past? Why should you trust their analog collections? If we are talking about film archives for example: How do you know the colors of a preservation copy are representative of the &ldquo;original&rdquo; colors? Most likely they are not&mldr; Can you even trust a film archive&rsquo;s analog originals? If you ask enough difficult questions, you quickly end up with a crisis of trust.</p><h2 id=digitization-and-mediation>Digitization and mediation</h2><p>These are old challenges of provenance, that I feel many have been completely blind to in the analog context. The moment a process or medium is digital, people assume it behaves in entirely new ways. I completely disagree with this. In my view, the digital domain behaves surprisingly similar to its analog counterpart.</p><p>Bastiansen&rsquo;s book that I mentioned earlier raises questions about how a cultural object changes the moment it is digitized. A TIFF resulting from scanning a paper newspaper is not &ldquo;the newspaper&rdquo;. &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; the TIFF and reading the newspaper are different ways of consuming media.</p><p>However, both Bastiansen and his critics seem to have a blindspot when it comes to the <em>analog</em> mediums. The analog technological mediation tends to be taken completely for granted in their analyses. The printed word is presented in such a &ldquo;self-mediating&rdquo; way, that you easily become blind to how its mediating technology actually works. There is paper, pages, ink, lettering, etc.</p><p>It is something new. I agree with this notion in part: the intellectual content or message in the newspaper is mediated in two different ways. However, both the TIFF and the newspaper are mediums.</p><h2 id=analog-mediation>Analog mediation</h2><p>Similarly to printed text, film is by design not drawing any attention to its mediating technology, but there is a lot going on to produce a moving image. Let&rsquo;s agree that the colors in a color film are an important aspect of its intellectual content.</p><p>If blue is exchanged for green, that is a significant change in the film&rsquo;s content and message. When you see a film, you see projected light. How that projected light appears is dependent on the mediating technology: the viewing environment, the type of screen, the type of projector light, the type of projector speed, the condition of the print, the type of print, how the print was color graded and printed and so on and so on&mldr;</p><p>For digitized materials you still have to account for the entirety of this analog technological framework, but you also have to account for the digitization framework (the type of digitization equipment and parameters, post-processing, format, etc.), <em>and</em> the technological viewing platform (the type of playback equipment and environment). This mediation is both complex and completely opaque to the general viewer.</p><ul><li>NOE OM AT DET DIGITALE faktisk gir nye muligheter for å dokumentere/bevise at ting er endret på over tid. egentlig lettere å ha kontroll der enn i det analoge.</li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Bastiansen, Henrik G. <a href=https://www.universitetsforlaget.no/nar-fortiden-blir-digital><em>Når fortiden blir digital: medier, kilder og historie i digitaliseringens tid.</em></a> Universitetsforlaget, 2023.
